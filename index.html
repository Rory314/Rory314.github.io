    <div style="font-size:22px; margin-bottom: 20px">The <b>R</b>oleplaying <b>O</b>verhaul <b>P</b>roject (<b>ROP</b>) aims to greatly enhance the community's roleplaying experience by creating a brand new game from scratch.</div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible"><h2>How will we do this?</h2></button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>A brand new game will be created. Doing this will allow for</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the creation of <b>completely custom maps</b> and <b>an end to landswapping</b>;</li>
            <li>a comprehensive set of <b>tools to allow game designers to draw and customise maps</b>, specify starting units and resources (and more) and have their ideas automatically turned into new game rounds;</li>
            <li>the addition of <b>new mechanics, units, and resources</b> that can all be customised to suit a particular game;</li>
            <li>an <b>end to tedious rule enforcement</b>, rules will instead be specified for each round and handled automatically;</li>
            <li>many more features to be decided by the community (see below).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Most importantly, the game will be created with roleplaying and the community in mind. This means no payments or unfair advantages, constant support for the community, and greatly expanded roleplaying features.</p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible"><h2>That sounds cool! How can I help?</h2></button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Whether you've designed your own rounds, have been around for years, or are just a newbie, we would love to hear from you about what you want to see.</p>
        <p>A short (anonymous) survey has been created for you to give your views on the current state of roleplaying in S1914 & CoW, how you feel about roleplaying in general, and what you want to see from a project like this.</p>
        <a href="google.com">Complete the survey</a>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible"><h2>How can I learn more about this?</h2></button>
    <div class="content">
